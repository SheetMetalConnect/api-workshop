# Course Information

## Overview

**Building RESTful APIs for MCP**  
https://www.iiot.university/products/2149123006

*Learn how to design, build, and deploy modern RESTful APIs using FastAPI in the context of Model Context Protocol (MCP) and manufacturing digital transformation. This hands-on workshop walks you through creating high-performance, well-documented APIs that connect existing systems to a Unified Namespace and enable future-ready MCP integrations.*

**Workshop Structure:**

**Iteration 0 \- Basic API**

* FastAPI setup and basics
* Uvicorn as ASGI server
* SQLAlchemy for database operations
* Pydantic for data validation

**Iteration 1 \- Security & Async**

* OAuth 2.0 implementation
* Encryption for sensitive data
* Async operations for non-blocking calls

**Additional iterations build on these foundations**

**Day 1 Format:**

* Lecture and API design exercises
* Understanding MCP in manufacturing context
* Prep work for Day 2 (GitHub repo setup, Auth0 configuration)

**Day 2 Format:**

* Hands-on coding with provided examples
* Progressive feature additions each iteration
* Building toward production-ready API

## **Why This Course Matters**

**The AI Integration Challenge:**

* AI needs structured access to manufacturing data
* Direct SQL connections don't work (slow queries, no schema knowledge, security risks)
* API layer provides necessary abstraction and control

**What Makes This Different:**

* Focused on manufacturing use cases and UNS architecture
* Combines REST for traditional apps with MCP for AI assistants
* Handles the complexity of event-driven manufacturing systems
* Progressive learning from basic API to full MCP integration
