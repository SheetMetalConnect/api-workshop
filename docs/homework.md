# Course Homework

## Brownfield Exercise: Evaluate Existing API

Select an API in your environment and score it for:

- How well does it use **resource-based structure** (nouns)?
- How well does it map to **HTTP Verbs**?
- How well does it make use of **HTTP Status Codes**?

## Greenfield Exercise: Design a New API

Select an API idea you'd like to build for a specific domain.

**Tasks:**

1. Design the **resources** for the domain
2. Design **routes** for operations for each resource (include HTTP Verbs)
3. Ensure you are designing in appropriate **HTTP Response Codes**

## Setup Requirements

**Environment Setup:**

1. Clone the api-workshop mono-repo `[QR Code]`
2. Navigate to `library-api-basic` directory
3. Follow the setup instructions in README.md
4. Verify you can run the REST API successfully

**Disclaimer:** Most of my experience is building REST APIs using C# and the .NET Core platform. If you are experienced in Python and could improve upon the code presented here, feel free to submit PRs to the repo so others can benefit too.
